Revision history for Dist-Zilla-Plugin-RewriteVersion-Transitional

0.009     2018-02-02 02:44:58Z
          - now providing a more helpful message when
            fallback_version_provider is needed, but missing (sorry, Olaf!)

0.008     2017-06-25 01:49:45Z
          - re-enable a test that will pass again after
            [BumpVersionAfterRelease] added the 'add_tarball_name' option

0.007     2015-07-16 18:58:00Z
          - work around (hopefully temporary) breakage with the addition of
            extra comments after $VERSION declarations by [RewriteVersion]

0.006     2015-06-28 06:05:57Z
          - add documentation amendment about the handling of multiple
            packages in a file, where not all of them have $VERSIONs.
          - warn when underscore versions are used -- no sanitization is
            added, so the runtime $VERSION will not be numeric

0.005     2015-05-20 02:32:40Z
          - now logging the number of version statements that were replaced
          - fix the name of the fallback version provider plugin used in
            [BumpVersionAfterRelease::Transitional] (shows up in log messages)
          - removed addition of # TRIAL suffix to the repository files after release

0.004     2015-01-19 03:49:55Z
          - avoid dying if [OurPkgVersion] is not installed
          - accomodate older [RewriteVersion], before skip_version_provider
            was added
          - accomodate the use of all [RewriteVersion] configuration options

0.003     2015-01-17 03:55:55Z
          - include the configs for the fallback_version_provider,
            [PkgVersion] and/or [OurPkgVersion], when used, in dumped
            configs
          - avoid misleading log messages when nothing was actually modified
            in the file

0.002     2015-01-13 06:06:52Z
          - first working version

0.001     2014-12-31 20:55:07Z (TRIAL RELEASE)
